- [ ] more flexible argument: size variable, biais to avoid comparing addresses etc.  
ie. main.py 0x0052:16:-4 0x0025:14:8
Here: 16 and 14 means the byte_sequence len will be 14. 
Here: -4 and 8 means too start the byte_sequence -4 byte before the addresses, or 8 byte after the addresses (same logic ofcourse apply to calculate output address)

- [ ] better output: If multiple matches in the new exe. correctly set it in the output and trigger a warning

- [ ] check dll support

- [ ] maybe add more executable file support 

- [ ] try to support packed executables/DLLs by integrating dynamic analysis (e.g., emulation and memory dumping) to capture fully unpacked code in RAM.
